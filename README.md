## About
It's simple project to test my first skills in React.

It includes 3 pages: `/`, `/business` and `/business/export-licence`  
If you want just to use - download `public` dir and run `index.html`Â in it.  
  
if you like to run full project - read next  

##Run project
  
1. For start, you need npm manager. I have used npm@3.10, so it could be some errors if you use another.  
2. After you download repo - run `npm install` to download all packages that project needs.  
3. Next run `npm start`. it starts `webpack-dev-server`, so now you can easily browse my project by your browser by `localhost:8080`.
